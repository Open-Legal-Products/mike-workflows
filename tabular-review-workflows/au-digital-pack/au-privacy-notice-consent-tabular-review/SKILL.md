# Privacy Notice & Consent Flow Review — Australia (Privacy Act / APPs)

## Instructions

- Apply each column prompt in `table-columns.yaml` to each document independently.
- Extract only information supported by the document text.
- Include clause references, section names, dates, amounts, party names, and defined terms where available.
- If responsive information is not found, return an empty value or a concise "Not found" response.
- Keep cell outputs concise while including enough context to make each extracted value useful.
- Do not invent citations, facts, parties, dates, rights, obligations, or financial consequences.
- Render the completed results as an exportable Excel (`.xlsx`) file. If Excel output is not possible, render the results as a Markdown table.
## Scope and legal anchors

- Review privacy-policy and collection-notice clauses and supplied consent-flow evidence under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), APPs and current identified OAIC guidance.
- The Privacy Act does not impose a universal PIA requirement. Agencies covered by the Privacy (Australian Government Agencies — Governance) APP Code 2017 must conduct a PIA for all high privacy risk projects. Assess whether that Code applies; otherwise use OAIC guidance to determine whether a PIA is warranted.
- Establish entity status, collection, use/disclosure and consent tests from current law; do not import GDPR requirements or infer actual operation from notice wording. Separate policy-text findings from tested flow observations.
- Determine current enactment and commencement status of each relevant reform from the Federal Register of Legislation and AGD/OAIC official sources, citing the instrument, provision, version, commencement table and assessment date. Separate proposals, enacted future duties and commenced duties; do not describe an enacted reform as merely proposed or assume a proposal is law.
- Separate document facts, supplied organisational materials (identify source/version), cited law with pinpoint references and current official-source version/status, and labelled assessments/proposals. Return Not found for missing facts and Not assessed for unsupported analysis. Never infer consent, ownership, approval, deadlines, prior positions or deployed controls from silence. Proposed actions require human approval; do not submit, publish, deploy or accept residual risk.
